## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was challenging trying to figure out how to combine state changes with input and submit button functionalities.
I also had no idea how to disable the buttons for when a certain index is reached but I was able to consult chatGPT for help and understand how the mechanism works.
